Hybrid Fashion Product Recommendation SystemAn end-to-end machine learning project designed to provide personalized product suggestions for an e-commerce platform by combining two powerful recommendation techniques: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.‚ú® Project HighlightsHybrid Approach: Implements a superior recommendation engine that leverages both user behavior (ratings) and item metadata (product name, brand, category, color, size) to maximize prediction accuracy.Core ML Algorithms: Utilizes $\mathbf{\text{SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)}}$ for Collaborative Filtering and $\mathbf{\text{TF-IDF}}$ vectorization with Cosine Similarity for Content-Based Filtering.E-commerce Data: Built and tested on a dataset of fashion products, simulating a real-world retail environment.‚öôÔ∏è Technical StackCategoryTool / LibraryPurposeLanguagePythonMain programming language.Data ProcessingPandasData manipulation and cleaning.Collaborative FilteringScikit-surprise (SVD)Implements Matrix Factorization for user-item behavior analysis.Content-Based FilteringScikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, linear_kernel)Generates item feature vectors and computes similarity.EvaluationCustom functionsCombines and filters recommendations from both models.üí° MethodologyThe system operates in three distinct stages to provide the final recommendation list:1. Content-Based FilteringFeature Combination: Product attributes (Name, Brand, Category, Color, Size) were concatenated into a single text-based 'Content' string for each product.Vectorization: A $\mathbf{\text{TF-IDF Vectorizer}}$ was used to convert the product 'Content' into a numerical matrix, highlighting the importance of specific keywords.Similarity Metric: Linear Kernel (equivalent to Cosine Similarity for normalized vectors) was calculated between all products to find items with similar features.2. Collaborative FilteringMatrix Factorization: The user-item interaction matrix (User ID, Product ID, Rating) was processed using the $\mathbf{\text{SVD algorithm}}$ from the surprise library.Behavioral Prediction: SVD factorizes the interaction matrix to learn latent factors for both users and products, allowing the prediction of a user's likely rating for unrated items.3. Hybrid CombinationThe final system aggregates the top recommendations from both the Content-Based Model and the Collaborative Filtering Model.This approach ensures high relevance (from content) while maintaining discoverability (from user patterns), addressing the limitations of single-model systems.üìä Quick Start / ExampleTo generate a list of the top $\mathbf{10}$ hybrid recommendations for a specific user, run the following Python code (as seen in the notebook):Pythonuser_id = 79
product_id = 5
top_n = 10

# Get recommendations based on user behavior (CF) and the features of product 5 (Content)
recommendations = get_hybrid_recommendations(user_id, product_id, top_n)

# Output:
# Hybrid Recommendations for User 79 based on Product 5:
# 1. Product ID: 1700
# 2. Product ID: 837
# 3. Product ID: 683
# ...
üöÄ Future ScopeDeployment: Integrate the recommender logic into a web service using Flask or FastAPI to provide real-time suggestions via an API endpoint.A/B Testing Simulation: Design an evaluation framework to compare the Click-Through Rate (CTR) or Conversion Rate of the hybrid model against a simpler baseline (e.g., Popularity-Based).Deep Learning Embeddings: Replace the traditional SVD and TF-IDF with a modern Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) approach to generate richer, more expressive user and item embeddings.üõ†Ô∏è InstallationClone the Repository:Bashgit clone [Your-Repo-Link-Here]
